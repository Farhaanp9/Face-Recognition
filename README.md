# Facial Recognition Surveillance System
This Internet of Things project implements a real-time facial recognition surveillance system using Python and OpenCV on a raspberry pi. The system captures video feed from a webcam, processes the frames to detect and recognize faces, and provides immediate feedback on identified individuals. It aims to enhance home security by identifying known individuals and alerting users in case of intruders.
